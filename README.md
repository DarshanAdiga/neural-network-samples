This is a redundant repo for publishing my kaggle kernels :D



## Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge

[Kaggle Challange](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only)

### Regression solution using Feedforward Neural Network

Just an experimental approach to the solution involving a 4-layered Feedforward neural network.

[The kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/darshanadiga/store-sale-forecasting-dnn-solution-ffnn)

### Time series forcasting using LSTM network: Single-variate

An initial approach to the solution by looking at the problem from a time-series forecasting perspective. However this solution is also **NOT complete** as it is a **single-variate time-series forecasting**.

### Time series forcasting using LSTM network: Multi-variate

This is the final approach to the solution. This kernel is **still work-in-progress**!!

TODO add the kernel link
